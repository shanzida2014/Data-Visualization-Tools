# Data-Visualization-Tools
Cytoscape is a data visualization tools.I used Cytoscape to  Analyzed the Tryptophan A (TrpA) protein-protein interaction Network from E.coli.
This files include the Microsoft Powerpoint presentation on it.

## Cytoscape : The De-facto Standard Tool For Biological Networks Visualization  
-- An open source platform for Biological Network data Integration, Analysis and Visualization.
--Developed and maintained by universities , companies and research institutions.
--De-facto standard software in biological research community
--Expandable by Apps
###### Three Basic Steps for Data Visualization with Cytoscape 
         Data Integration
         Analysis/Mapping
         Visualization
###### A small E. coli protein-protein interaction network obtained from the STRING database
###### Afterthat Data were integrated into Cytoscape
###### Then manipulated nodes and edges.
###### Lastly created Atributes Circle Network,Perfuse Perfuse Force directed open CL layout and Perfuse Force Directed Layout
